# ðŸ‘‹ Hello Fellow Coder!

## This repository showcases my web development practice using the site [Frontend-Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/), helping me to further solidify and expand my frontend knowledge. The projects within this repository are completed using a combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
## I created a landing [page](https://mark-elayache.github.io/Frontend-Mentor) for you to surf between the different completed challenges.
